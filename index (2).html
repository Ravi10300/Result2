<p class="pt">While there are many advantages of such websites, we also need to be aware of the negatives. Students need to be guided properly. Without proper guidance, students may find resources and content that are not reliable or do not align with the direction of the teaching in class. Some websites are huge and offer a massive variety of games and resources. Students may be easily distracted on such websites and end up spending time on activities that are either below their level or do not complement or add to the classroom teaching. Unrestricted access and freedom on the internet can be dangerous, especially for younger students.

    Choosing websites
    
    It is important that we carefully consider what websites to introduce to the students. We need to keep a number of elements in mind while choosing educational websites: The activities on the website should align to what is being taught in the classroom and the academic level of the students. The website should be appropriate to the age of the students. Sites that cater to a range of interests or learning styles are preferable. In addition,  it is essential that the websites that are safe (that have no adult ads or links), and have reliable content. Finally, it is helpful to use websites that are designed for classroom learning, i.e. allow the teacher to monitor game scores, view progress, etc.</p>
